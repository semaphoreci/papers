# Papers

Selected CI/CD articles published by Semaphore.

## Production

![Semaphore build](https://semaphore-oss.semaphoreci.com/badges/papers.svg)

Content is written in Markdown, final PDF made with [Pandoc][pandoc].

We're using official [Docker images of Pandoc][pandoc-docker].
You need to have Docker installed to build the PDF. See `Makefile`.

Semaphore automatically creates and uploads the PDF as an artifact from the
latest version of source text. See [project on Semaphore][semaphore-project].

## How to add a paper

1. Copy the original source file in markdown to the `tmp/` folder.
2. Copy any related images into the `papers/` folder. Any images in the markdown source should be relative to this folder.
3. Add the header contents of `header.md` to the markdown file. The header must contain [valid metadata](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#metadata-variables):

        cat header.md tmp/MY-AWESOME-PAPER.md > papers/MY-AWESOME-PAPER.md

4. Append the contents of `footer.md` to the markdown file:

        cat footer.md >> papers/MY-AWESOME-PAPER.md

5. Review the markdown file (see next section).
6. (Optional) Add a cover PDF into the `covers` dir. The filenames of the generated and cover PDF must match.
7. Edit `Makefile` and add the new filename *without the extension or path* to the list in `PAPERS`:

        PAPERS = paper-1 paper-2 ... MY-AWESOME-PAPER

8. Build all the PDFs: `make pdf`
9. Output PDF is in: `build/pdf/MY-AWESOME-PAPER.pdf`

## Reviewing the markdown source

Open the markdown file and check the following:

- Adjust the size of the images: add `{ width=100% }` at the end of the line and tweak the width as needed.

        ![An image](./public/MY-AWESOME-PAPER/image1.png){ width=65% }

- Check for long lines in code fences, you may need to split them to prevent clipping.
- Fill in publication details in the footer. The strings starting with \__BUILD\_* are automatically expanded.
