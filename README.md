# Papers

Selected CI/CD articles published by Semaphore.

## Production

![Semaphore build](https://semaphore-oss.semaphoreci.com/badges/papers.svg)

Content is written in Markdown, final PDF made with [Pandoc][pandoc].

We're using official [Docker images of Pandoc][pandoc-docker].
You need to have Docker installed to build the PDF. See `Makefile`.

Semaphore automatically creates and uploads the PDF as an artifact from the
latest version of source text. See [project on Semaphore][semaphore-project].

## How to add a paper

1. Copy the original source file in markdown and related images into the `papers/` folder.
Any images should be relative to this folder.
2. Append the contents of `footer.md` to the markdown file:

        cat footer.md >> papers/MY-AWESOME-PAPER.md

3. Review the markdown file (see next section).
4. Edit `Makefile` and add the new filename *without the extension or path* to the list in `PAPERS`:

        PAPERS = paper-1 paper-2 ... MY-AWESOME-PAPER

5. Build all the PDFs: `make pdf`
6. Output PDF is in: `build/pdf/MY-AWESOME-PAPER.pdf`

## Reviewing the markdown source

Open the markdown file and check the following:

- Add a title at the beginning.
- Adjust the size of the images: add `{ width=100% }` at the end of the line and tweak the width as needed.

        ![An image](./public/MY-AWESOME-PAPER/image1.png){ width=65% }

- Fill in publication values in the footer. The strings starting with \__BUILD\_* are automatically expanded, leave them.
